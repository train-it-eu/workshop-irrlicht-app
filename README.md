# Irrlicht workshop

## The Irrlicht Engine

- An open source high performance realtime 3D engine written in C++
- Completely cross-platform, using D3D, OpenGL, and its own software renderers
- Has all of the state-of-the-art features which can be found in commercial 3D engines
- A huge active community, and there are lots of projects in development that use the engine
- It's completely free
- http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net


## Workshop project

### Purpose

- Easy to use collection of wrappers around Irrlicht 3D rendering engine

### Classes

- `workshop::engine`
  - responsible for creating and configuring Irrlicht framework and fixed level map
- `workshop::camera`
  - the interface to position engine camera on the level map according to user needs
- `workshop::object_handle`
  - handle to 1 of 4 fixed characters (position, rotation, highlighting, etc.)
- `workshop::selector`
  - connection between engine and the object used by collision detection
- `workshop::event_receiver`
  - detects events generated by the user (i.e. keypress)

## Goal of the workshop

- Create 3D engine
  - light
  - camera
  - selection laser
  - main loop
- Add 4 different characters
  - when selected by the laser they should be highlighted and their name should appear
    in a label
